        <p> This award goes to Giveon, one of my favorite artists. Although Uzi comes in close second, I just love Giveon's music so much. The vibe is everything, and I can't wait to see him grow as an arist. In my opinion, his albums are the ones that you can't skip over. Support him on youtube, and other platforms, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdzVQj2L98c25-U8yb0SxuzbvpT2dUzAD">here!</a> His music is also on Spotfify, which you should also check out, for sure!</p>
        
        <p> Our next award: Favorite Poet!</p>
        <h2>Favorite Poet - Rupi Kaur</h2>

        <p>This award goes to one of my favorite poets, Rupi Kaur! Known for one of her best selling poems, Milk and Honey, Rupi is top tier when it comes to making poems. Not only that, but she is a beautiful, Indian poet, that self edits, writes, and illustrates all of her poems. Her poems have helped millions of people, young and old, find themselves and feel like they have a place of belonging. More can be found out about her at her <a href="https://rupikaur.com/">home page</a>, it was a honor discovering her!</p>
        
        <p>And for our last award of this website: Favorite Cartoon Creator!</p>
        <h2>Favorite Cartoon Creators - Alex Hirsch and Daron Nefcy</h2>

        <p> For this award, I couldn't even choose just one! I grew up with both Gravity Falls, created by Alex Hirsch, and Star vs the force of evil, created by Daron Nefcy. Both are prior to my childhood and make up who I am today, so both cartoon creators recieve this reward. I still, to this day, rewatch both! Thank you Alex Hirsch and Daron Nefcy for creating my favorite cartoons! If you want to watch yourself, you can go to <a href="https://www.thewatchcartoononline.tv/cartoon-list">Watch Cartoon Online</a> or any other cartoon website!!</p>
        <h2> Closing Statement!</h2>
        <p> These are all my personal preference, and honest opinions. To whoever's reading, I hope this inspired you to make this as well, or look into some of my favs! This project was really fun to work on :) </p>
